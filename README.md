# MoonPascal

MoonPascal is based on the concept and interfaces of VerySimple.Lua,
originally written by Dennis D. Spreen - but uses a different approach to
realise dynamic generation of Delphi interfaces for Lua.

It has improved support for registering delphi class and object methods,
support for Lua namespaces (multiple sublevels), automatically mapping
of enumeration types and garbage collection.
